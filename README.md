# CityGenie

The prototype conception was in turn of an idea related to make possible to the new ones in town to get to know a little better the city they are coming in. The main goal is to let each user choose which monuments they want to visit and to provide them with some knowledge about it. In association to this, we tried to get some partners, and we create a goal inside the application to improve the clients' retention, with our partners. This goal has a reward system through points in order to take the users to the monuments and to our partners, giving them points that they can change for rewards. 

Each user has his personal page, in which he can see the monuments he visited and his position on the leader board and can also check the monuments still "available" (with rewards to claim), the same monuments he didn't check.

The client has available for himself to check the information about each monument, once he arrived at the place and for the first time, and he can also redeem points, as reward. Still on client's hands he has the possibility to check which partners we have connections with and some sort of advertising (related to them), he can check the leader board and collect points every time he visits and consume at our partners. 

All these functionalities need authentication from the user (or registration in cases they don't have any account yet).

On the services side, they can change or add the punctuation on the monuments and partners, and they still can add or remove adverts and choose the position of them on the screen.

For admin, the tasks available inside specially in management (creation or deletion) of partners and monuments available on the application, and this function can also mess with the punctuation of them. He can also give the prizes to the users who had the necessary points and ask for "redeem". Only the admin as access to make 
analysis to the leader board and to check on clients / usersâ€™ points
